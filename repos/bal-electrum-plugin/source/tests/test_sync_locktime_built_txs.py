"""
Tests for ``BalBuildWillDialog._sync_locktime_to_built_txs``.

This is the post-build sync that keeps the plugin's stored delivery date
(WILL_SETTINGS["locktime"]) and check-alive threshold in lockstep with the
BUILT transactions' fixed locktime.  The bug it fixes (reported by the owner):

    ADVANCED mode + RELATIVE locktime ("90d") / threshold ("30d") -> the plugin
    asks to invalidate the will EVERY DAY.  The relative value is re-parsed
    against "now" on every check, so it drifts one day per day away from the
    fixed tx locktime and the postpone check always sees a "postpone".

The method is exercised with a lightweight fake ``self`` (no Qt event loop, no
Electrum wallet) by calling it as an unbound method.

Run:
    source /home/steal/devel/bal/electrum/env/bin/activate
