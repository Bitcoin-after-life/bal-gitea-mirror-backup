Tests for ``BalBuildWillDialog._sync_locktime_to_built_txs``.

This is the post-build sync that keeps the plugin's stored delivery date
(WILL_SETTINGS["locktime"]) in lockstep with the BUILT transactions' fixed
locktime when the core AUTOMATICALLY anticipates it (one day earlier than
stored).

RELATIVE recipes ("90d" / "1y") are now PRESERVED: the daily-drift problem
that once forced freezing them to absolute timestamps is solved at the root by
anchoring every relative recipe against the built transactions
(``Util.resolve_locktime_against_tx`` for the postpone detection,
``resolve_date_to_check(..., built_locktime=...)`` for the reference
timestamp).  Only a genuine automatic anticipation on an ABSOLUTE stored date
moves the stored value.

The method is exercised with a lightweight fake ``self`` (no Qt event loop, no
Electrum wallet) by calling it as an unbound method.
